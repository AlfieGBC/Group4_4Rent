> 4 Rent Mobile Application: Role-Based Rental Management System
<hr>
The 4 Rent Mobile Application introduces a role-based rental management system with three distinct user roles: Guest, Tenant, and Landlord. Guests can search and filter rentals, tenants enjoy the advanced search and favorite list features, while landlords can post and manage rental listings. Also, all the users can see blogs as well. This approach ensures a tailored and efficient rental experience for all users.
